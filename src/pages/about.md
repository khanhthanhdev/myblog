Hi! I'm Thanh.

I'm a high school student who loves science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). I'm really interested in robots and coding.

Here are some cool things I've done:
- I got FIRST Prize at Vietnam AI Contest 2024 by VLAB Innovation and Boston Global Forum (My team include: me, Huy Khanh, Hoang Minh, Huy Anh, Manh Linh)
- I competed in a robotics challenge called [FIRST Global Challenge](https://first.global/about/) in Singapore and won a gold medal 
- I went to a [Math and Science Summer Program](https://www.masspvn.org/) where I learned about Data Science and Machine Learning. 
- My team wrote a research paper about making summaries of long medical documents even better using LSG Attention for BART Model.


I started a club called Ung Hoa B Robotics and STEAM Club to teach other students about STEM fields.
In the club, I've learned even more about robot programming, STEM activities. We participated in many robotics challenge and make many experiences in physic and chemistry in school.
It's fun to help others and keep learning new things!
