Hello! I’m Thanh. I am a passionate high school student with interest in STEM, robotics, and programming. 

Recently, I had the privilege of competing at [FIRST Global Challenge 2023](https://first.global/about/) in Singapore, where I won the Gold Medal for Finalist Winning Alliance. I participated in [Math and Science Summer Program](https://www.masspvn.org/en) and learned about Machine Learning. Moreover, my team has researched a paper about "Enhance Long Medical Document Summarize with LSG Attention".

My technical journey includes skills in programming languages like Python, JavaScript, and C++, alongside hands-on experience in web development and machine learning.

Driven by a desire to inspire and support my peers, I founded the Ung Hoa B Robotics and STEAM Club, where I lead various initiatives to mentor students interested in these fields. Through this club, I have had the chance to dive deep into robot programming, data science, and artificial intelligence, continuously pushing myself to expand my knowledge and contribute meaningfully to my community.


I designed and crafted this based on [my personal blog](https://khanhthanh.dev).
