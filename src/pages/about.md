Hi! I'm Thanh.

I will study Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Vin University](https://cecs.vinuni.edu.vn/) . I love science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). I'm really interested in robots and coding.

Currently, I'm volunteer at [STEAM For Vietnam](https://www.steamforvietnam.org/en) with role Software Engineering and Role Developer. I join project like building Robotics Tournament Management system, AI Agent for teacher, Robotic Tournament (coming soon).


Here are some cool things I've done:
- I got FIRST Prize at Vietnam AI Contest 2024 by VLAB Innovation and Boston Global Forum (My team include: me, Huy Khanh, Hoang Minh, Huy Anh, Manh Linh)
- I competed in a robotics challenge called [FIRST Global Challenge](https://first.global/about/) in Singapore and won a gold medal 
- I went to a [Math and Science Summer Program](https://www.masspvn.org/) where I learned about Data Science and Machine Learning. 
- My team wrote a research paper about making summaries of long medical documents even better using LSG Attention for BART Model.
